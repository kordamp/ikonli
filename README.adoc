Ikonli provides icon packs that can be used in Java applications. Currently Swing and JavaFX UI toolkits are supported.

== Installing

You can get the latest version of **Ikonli** directly from link:https://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|{project-group}[Maven Central].

Refer to the link:http://{project-owner}.github.io/ikonli/[guide, window="_blank"] for further information on configuration
and usage.

== Building

You must meet the following requirements:

 * JDK11 as a minimum
 * Gradle 6.4+

You may use the included gradle wrapper script if you don't have `gradle` installed.

Adapt these instructions to Windows settings if running on Windows.

=== Installing Gradle

.Manual

 . Download Gradle from http://gradle.org/downloads
 . Unzip the file into a directory without spaces (recommended).
 . Create a GRADLE_HOME environment variable that points to this directory.
 . Adjust your PATH environment variable to include $GRADLE_HOME/bin (%GRADLE_HOME%\bin on Windows).
 . Test your setup by invoking `gradle --version`.

.SDKMAN

 . Follow the instructions found at http://sdkman.io/ to install SDKMAN.
 . You need a POSIX environment if running Windows. We recommend using Babun Shell (http://babun.github.io/)
 . Once SDKMAN is installed invoke `sdk install gradle 6.9.2`.
 . Test your setup by invoking `gradle --version`.

.Gum

Gum is a wrapper script that facilitates invoking gradle tasks anywhere within a Gradle project. It's smart enough
to use the gradle wrapper if available or your global gradle command. This is an optional download.

 . Follow the instructions found at https://github.com/kordamp/gm to install gum
